# **P-Formance**
**Science-Based, Fructose-Free Sports Nutrition**
Fueling Peak Performance Without Gut Distress
<br>
*TUM Venture Lab Pitch*

## The Problem: The Endurance Athlete's Achilles' Heel

Endurance athletes push their limits, but their performance is often sabotaged by their fuel.

* **Widespread GI Distress:** **30% to 90%** of endurance athletes suffer from bloating, cramps, and nausea, severely impacting performance. [cite: 1, 37]
    * <span class="problem-icon">ü§¢</span>
* **The Fructose Factor:** Common in sports fuels, fructose has limited absorption (GLUT5 pathway, ~30g/hr). Unabsorbed fructose causes osmotic distress. [cite: 1, 16, 38, 39, 40]
* **Glucose-Only Limits:** High-dose glucose/maltodextrin fuels can also cause GI issues if SGLT1 transporter capacity (~60-70g/hr) is exceeded. [cite: 14, 51]
* **Demand for Clean Fuel:** Athletes seek simple, transparent, and effective formulas.

## Introducing P-Formance: Our Mission

**P-Formance is dedicated to solving exercise-induced GI distress for endurance athletes by pioneering high-performance, fructose-free sports nutrition.**

Our Tagline:
<div class="bg-light-orange">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 22px; color: #1A1A1A;"><i>"Science-based sports nutrition that does not strain the gut during performance as it avoids fructose and offers simple, clean, and tested formulas for athletes."</i></p>
</div>

We continue the journey Maurten started, with a laser focus on **fructose-free** solutions for runners and cyclists.

## The P-Formance Solution: A Gut-Friendly Revolution

We tackle the problem head-on with a multi-pronged, science-backed approach:

1.  <span class="solution-icon">üö´</span> **Complete Fructose Avoidance:**
    * The cornerstone of our products.
    * Directly eliminates a primary trigger for GI upset. [cite: 38]
    * Reliable fuel for fructose-sensitive athletes and those seeking cleaner energy.

2.  <span class="solution-icon">üî¨</span> **Optimized Glucose & Maltodextrin Science:**
    * Focus on maximizing energy delivery and gut comfort **solely via the SGLT1 pathway**. [cite: 14]
    * **Maltodextrin as Key:** Lower sweetness, lower osmolality for faster gastric emptying and reduced GI risk. [cite: 62]
    * Formulations scientifically designed for efficient SGLT1 fueling (up to ~60-70g/hr). [cite: 14]

3.  <span class="solution-icon">üåø</span> **Simple, Clean, Tested Formulas:**
    * Minimal, high-quality, essential ingredients.
    * No unnecessary fillers or artificial additives.
    * Transparent, tested, and trustworthy.

## The P-Formance Advantage: Our Novelty

**Novelty in Fructose-Free Performance Nutrition**

* **The Market Gap:** Many brands use fructose in MTC systems. [cite: 6] P-Formance offers a **distinct, scientifically-backed alternative.**
* **Our Specialization:** We are perfecting **high-performance, fructose-free fuel.**
* **Targeted Solution:** For the significant segment of athletes seeking clean, simple energy **without fructose**, who don't want to compromise gut comfort or effective fueling (up to SGLT1 capacity). [cite: 14]

## Key Benefits of the P-Formance Approach

* <span class="text-orange" style="font-size: 28px;">‚úÖ</span> **Significantly Reduced Gastrointestinal Distress:**
    By avoiding fructose and optimizing glucose/maltodextrin formulations. [cite: 38]

* <span class="text-orange" style="font-size: 28px;">‚ö°</span> **Effective & Sustained Energy:**
    Reliable carbohydrate delivery via the SGLT1 pathway, fueling muscles efficiently. [cite: 14]

* <span class="text-orange" style="font-size: 28px;">üîç</span> **Athlete-Centric Transparency:**
    Clean labels, tested products, building trust with runners and cyclists.

* <span class="text-orange" style="font-size: 28px;">üòå</span> **No Compromise:**
    Athletes no longer need to choose between fueling adequately and feeling good.
